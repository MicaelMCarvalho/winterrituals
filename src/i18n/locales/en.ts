      description:
        "I'm Micael, born and raised in Lazarim, a place where carnival comes to life in a unique way. As a son of this tradition, I developed an ever-growing passion for discovering rituals similar to those of my homeland. I'm fascinated not only by the cultural and symbolic richness of each of these celebrations but also by the opportunity to document them through photography, thus preserving their essence for future generations. \nDuring my journey of discovery, I realized there was no centralized and easily accessible space where anyone could discover when and where these unique festivities take place. It was from this need and passion that the idea of creating this platform was born. \nBeing a software engineer, I realized I could unite my two passions: technology and popular traditions, creating a digital space where these cultural manifestations can be discovered, shared, and preserved in a simple and accessible way for everyone.",
